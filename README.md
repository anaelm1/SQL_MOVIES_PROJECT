# 🎥 IMDb Movies Portfolio Project

**Code**: `/Queries`

**Database**: PostgreSQL

**Dataset**: IMDb Datasets ([IMDb Interfaces](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/))

**Focus**: In-depth SQL analysis of global movie data — ratings, genres, creators, and trends.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project explores the rich IMDb movie dataset to uncover patterns in movie production, viewer preferences, and contributions from key creators. By excluding non-movie types (e.g., TV episodes and adult titles), the analysis remains sharply focused on feature-length films. A full cycle of database design, data cleaning, SQL querying, and visualization delivers insights into the film industry.

### Key Stages:

* PostgreSQL Database Setup
* Data Cleaning & Normalization
* Query Design & EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
* AI-generated Visualizations (ChatGPT)

## 📊 Visual Analysis

### 1. Top 20 IMDb Movies by Rating

![Top Movies]([sandbox:/mnt/data/top_20_movies_bar_chart.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anaelm1/SQL_MOVIES_PROJECT/refs/heads/main/Visuals/top_20_movies_bar_chart.png?raw=true))
*Generated by ChatGPT*

This chart shows the most critically acclaimed movies according to IMDb ratings, filtered to include only those with at least 10,000 votes. Notable entries include classics like *The Shawshank Redemption*, *The Godfather*, and *12 Angry Men*. The visual highlights how some lesser-known titles like *The Chaos Class* and *Ramayana* have gained high ratings from niche audiences, demonstrating the breadth of global cinema.

### 2. Number of Movies Released Each Year (2005–2024)

![Movies by Year]([sandbox:/mnt/data/movies_per_year_2005_2024.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anaelm1/SQL_MOVIES_PROJECT/refs/heads/main/Visuals/movies_per_year_2005_2024.png?raw=true))
*Generated by ChatGPT*

Movie production saw steady growth until 2019, peaking just before the COVID-19 pandemic. 2020 and 2021 show a clear drop, followed by recovery and stabilization in the years after. This trend is indicative of both the disruption caused by global events and the industry's resilience.

---

### 3. Most Common Movie Genres

![Genres]([sandbox:/mnt/data/most_common_movie_genres.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anaelm1/SQL_MOVIES_PROJECT/refs/heads/main/Visuals/most_common_movie_genres.png?raw=true))
*Generated by ChatGPT*

Drama dominates the genre distribution, followed by Documentary and Comedy. Action, Romance, and Thriller also remain popular. This chart was generated by splitting multi-genre entries using `STRING_TO_ARRAY` and `UNNEST`, which ensures all genres for a single movie are fairly counted. It reflects global storytelling preferences leaning toward emotion, reality, and entertainment.

### 4. Directors with Most Highly-Rated Movies

![Top Directors]([sandbox:/mnt/data/top_directors_high_rated_movies.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anaelm1/SQL_MOVIES_PROJECT/refs/heads/main/Visuals/top_directors_high_rated_movies.png?raw=true))
*Generated by ChatGPT*

This visual spotlights directors who have produced the most movies rated above 8 on IMDb. *Dylan Verrechia* and *Sergey A.* top the list with over 25 titles. This suggests not only a strong creative vision but also consistency in delivering critically appreciated content. Industry legends like *Satyajit Ray* and *Christopher Nolan* also appear, validating the query's effectiveness.

### 5. Average Runtime by Genre

![Runtime by Genre]([sandbox:/mnt/data/avg_runtime_by_genre_darkgrid.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anaelm1/SQL_MOVIES_PROJECT/refs/heads/main/Visuals/avg_runtime_by_genre_darkgrid.png?raw=true))
*Generated by ChatGPT*

Action and Musical films average the longest runtimes, often exceeding 100 minutes. Documentaries, Westerns, and Shorts are significantly shorter. This data can be useful for filmmakers, editors, and content planners to set benchmarks for pacing and structure.

---

## 🔍 Advanced SQL Techniques Applied

* **Joins**: Multi-table joins between ratings, crew, and name data
* **UNNEST & STRING\_TO\_ARRAY**: Handling multi-genre fields
* **Filtering & Grouping**: With `WHERE`, `HAVING`, `GROUP BY`
* **Aggregate Functions**: `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`
* **Date Logic**: Filtering by year range (last 20 years)

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Built a normalized SQL database and imported IMDb data
* Designed and optimized five insightful queries
* Used AI-generated Matplotlib visuals to bring SQL results to life
* Learned to translate raw data into industry-relevant insights
