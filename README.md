# 🎥 IMDb Movies Project

**Code**: `/Queries`

**Database**: PostgreSQL

**Dataset**: IMDb Datasets ([IMDb Interfaces](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/))

**Focus**: In-depth SQL analysis of global movie data — ratings, genres, creators, and trends.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project explores the rich IMDb movie dataset to uncover patterns in movie production, viewer preferences, and contributions from key creators. The analysis remains sharply focused on feature-length films by excluding non-movie types (e.g., TV episodes and adult titles). A full cycle of database design, data cleaning, SQL querying, and visualization delivers insights into the film industry. The dataset on which the research is done is of around 700,000 unique movies. 

### Key Stages:

* PostgreSQL Database Setup
* Data Cleaning & Normalization
* Query Design & EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
* AI-generated Visualizations (ChatGPT)

## 🔍 Advanced SQL Techniques Applied

* **Joins**: Multi-table joins between ratings, crew, and name data
* **UNNEST & STRING\_TO\_ARRAY**: Handling multi-genre fields
* **Filtering & Grouping**: With `WHERE`, `HAVING`, `GROUP BY`
* **Aggregate Functions**: `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`
* **Date Logic**: Filtering by year range (last 20 years)
